**Netflix SQL Project** 
**Tools: SQL, Excel** 
This project has provided valuable insights into the platform's content landscape. By using sql for analysis and excel for visualization the database, we have identified the countries contributing the most content, shed light on the types of content receiving increased attention in recent years, and explored the distribution of ratings and genres. These findings can inform content acquisition strategies, user engagement efforts, and platform enhancements, ultimately contributing to a more tailored and enriching Netflix experience for viewers worldwide.

**The NYC Flights 13 Project** 
**Tools: R** 
This project provides a dataset covering all on-time flights departing from New York City airports (JFK, LGA, or EWR) throughout 2013, organized into three tables: flights, airlines, and airports. Our goal is to analyze key aspects to improve flight operations. We'll start by identifying the busiest airlines in September 2013 and then calculate average departure and arrival delays for each airline. Next, we'll determine the most popular New York City destinations and identify which airlines operate the longest routes. Additionally, we'll uncover the most common flight routes and pinpoint the top five airlines serving Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) between January and June 2013. These insights will help enhance flight services and passenger experiences.
