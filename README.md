Netflix SQL Project - This project has provided valuable insights into the platform's content landscape. By analyzing the database, we have identified the countries contributing the most content, shed light on the types of content receiving increased attention in recent years, and explored the distribution of ratings and genres. These findings can inform content acquisition strategies, user engagement efforts, and platform enhancements, ultimately contributing to a more tailored and enriching Netflix experience for viewers worldwide.
