**The NYC Flights 13 Project** / 
**Tools: R** 
This project provides a dataset covering all on-time flights departing from New York City airports (JFK, LGA, or EWR) throughout 2013, organized into three tables: flights, airlines, and airports. Our goal is to analyze key aspects to improve flight operations. We'll start by identifying the busiest airlines in September 2013 and then calculate average departure and arrival delays for each airline. Next, we'll determine the most popular New York City destinations and identify which airlines operate the longest routes. Additionally, we'll uncover the most common flight routes and pinpoint the top five airlines serving Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) between January and June 2013. These insights will help enhance flight services and passenger experiences.
